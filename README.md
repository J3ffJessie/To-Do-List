# To-Do-List
Simple To-Do List built using NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB

Simple ToDo list that my Wife and I utilize to keep family notes synced together.  Easily could share an Apple Reminder, but what would
be the fun in that when I can just create one? So I did just that using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

Deployed on Heroku, utilizes MongoDB for database purposes and syncing the notes on the backend so that we can both view the todo's on the list and check them off.
Express Server and NodeJS utilized for the routing and server.

Future use for a larger scale TODO list platform for use within neighborhood for large gatherings for parties and things of that like.
